Each required task have its own dedicated folder named after the task

--> Inside the folder:
 	1.	A Python file (the code) named of task
 	2.	The output results (such as images, videos, screenshots, and similar files), also named of task.

Example:
Task 2 → Task2.py + Task2.mp4 + Task2.png

The same structure applies to all tasks.
